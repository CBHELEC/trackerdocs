# Using the Dashboard

If you are following this in order, which is unlikely, you previously will have opened, and logged into the Dashboard. You are now ready to start configuring your server's settings, so let's do that now.

To configure your server, follow these steps:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once again, we recommend doing this on a Computer (PC or Laptop). The mobile UI is frankly cursed and we will fix it in due time.
{% endhint %}

{% step %}
### Select a Server

You need to actually pick a server to configure, so look through the grid of servers until you find the one you want to configure. Then simply click (or press) on that server to open it. If Tracker is not in that server, it will appear greyed out with a :icon-plus: symbol next to it instead of a :icon-chevron-right: symbol, and clicking on it opens a Tracker invite to that server. However, if it is in the server, it would have a :icon-chevron-right: symbol and open to that server's specific configuration page.
{% endstep %}

### Configure Skullboard

Now you've selected a server, you can start to configure the various settings. The first of these you will see is skullboard. To find out more about skullboard, <a href="https://docs.trackerbot.xyz/features/skullboard" class="button secondary">click here</a>. To configure it, click the dropdown menu the show a list of the server's channels. Then simply click the channel you want skullboard to send to, and click 'Set Channel'. If you want to disable skullboard, click the 'ðŸš« | Disable' option and click 'Set Channel'.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Permission Roles

Below skullboard, you can see a slightly larger dropdown box. This is how you can configure permission roles. To find out more about permission roles, <a href="https://docs.trackerbot.xyz/features/permroles" class="button secondary">click here</a>. Click on the dropdown box, and you see a list of roles in your server. From there, its easy - click on a role you want to give permissions for (see permissions <a href="https://docs.trackerbot.xyz/features/permroles" class="button secondary">here</a>), and then click 'Set Roles' to confirm that. To remove permission roles, click the cute lil' :icon-x: next to the role you want to remove, before clicking 'Set Roles' to confirm that.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Feature Toggles

Finally, after permission roles, there are a series of buttons. These toggle various features, more info on which can be found <a href="https://docs.trackerbot.xyz/features/toggles" class="button secondary">here</a>. For each feature which can be toggled, there are two buttons. ':icon-check: Enable' and ':icon-x: Disable'. It's simple enough as is, but to enable the feature you click ':icon-check: Enable' and to disable the feature you click ':icon-x: Disable'. These auto-save as you click them.
