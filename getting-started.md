# Getting Started

## Installing Tracker in your server <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

Put simply, it needs to be in your server to work. Here is how you can do that, as quickly as possible.

1. Open https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz in any browser.
2. Login with your Discord account.
3. Find the server you want to install Tracker in, and click on it. If it isn't already in that server, it will open an invite link. Then click 'Add to Server', 'Continue', review the listed permissions and hit 'Authorise'.

* To avoid any issues, please keep all listed permissions. Tracker can work with more permissions too, however they will not be used.

## What do the permissions mean

* View Channels
  * Allows the bot to view channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in
* Send Messages (in threads)
  * Allows the bot to send messages in channels and / or threads which it has allow or neutral permissions in
* Embed Links
  * Allows the bot to send links which have embed previews below them
* Attach Files
  * Allows the bot to send images, audio or any files
* Read Message History
  * Allows the bot to read previous messages in channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in
* Use External Emojis
  * Allows the bot to use emojis from other servers in its messages and embeds. This is neccesary
