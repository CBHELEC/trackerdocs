Since I am human, I still make mistakes, so if you spot any please notify us in our Support Server."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started"},{"l":"Installing Tracker in your server","p":["Put simply, it needs to be in your server to work. Here is how you can do that, as quickly as possible.","Open https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz in any browser.","Login with your Discord account.","Find the server you want to install Tracker in, and click on it. If it isn't already in that server, it will open an invite link. Then click 'Add to Server', 'Continue', review the listed permissions and hit 'Authorise'.","To avoid any issues, please keep all listed permissions. Tracker can work with more permissions too, however they will not be used."]},{"l":"What do the permissions mean","p":["View Channels","Allows the bot to view channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Send Messages (in threads)","Allows the bot to send messages in channels and / or threads which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Embed Links","Allows the bot to send links which have embed previews below them","Attach Files","Allows the bot to send images, audio or any files","Read Message History","Allows the bot to read previous messages in channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Use External Emojis","Allows the bot to use emojis from other servers in its messages and embeds. This is neccesary"]}],[{"l":"Accessing the Dashboard","p":["The Dashboard is the intuitive, simple to use webpage which you can use to configure Tracker in your own server. Instead of using clunky, long commands which are quite frankly just bad, just open the Dashboard, select a server and start configuring!","To access the Dashboard, follow these steps:","On any web browser, navigate to https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz. Be patient, it may take a second or two to load.","We recommend doing this on a Computer (PC or Laptop). The mobile UI is frankly cursed and we will fix it in due time.","Once you have opened the Dashboard, press the 'Login' button in the middle of the page. This will redirect you to the Discord Authorisation page, where you can review the permissions and then press 'Authorise'.","Once these steps have been followed, you should see a grid of the servers that you are in. You are now ready to start configuring!"]}],[{"l":"Using the Dashboard","p":["After logging in, find the server you would like to configure","After selecting a server, find the buttons under the relevant feature text","After selecting a server, find the dropdown under the text saying 'Choose a skullboard channel:'","After selecting a server, find the dropdown under the text saying 'Choose permission roles:'","Click on it","Click on the dropdown","Click on the dropdown box","Click the 'Login' button and authorise via Discord","Go to the dashboard ( https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz)","If you are following this in order, which is unlikely, you previously will have opened, and logged into the Dashboard. You are now ready to start configuring your server's settings, so let's do that now.","Select a channel where skullboarded messages will go, and click 'Set Channel'","Select as many roles as you want, and click 'Set Roles'","To configure your server, follow these steps:","To disable skullboard, press the '\uD83D\uDEAB | Disable' option, and click 'Set Channel'","To disable that feature, click the 'Disable' button","To enable that feature (default), click the 'Enable' button","To remove roles, simply click the 'x' next to the role you want to remove, and click 'Set Roles'","Use the tabs in the above table to get instructions for the relevant section.","You are logged in!","You have configured permission roles!","You have configured skullboard!","You have selected a server!","You have toggled a toggle!","You need to actually pick a server to configure, so look through the grid of servers until you find the one you want to configure. Then simply click (or press) on that server to open it. If Tracker is not in that server, it will appear greyed out with a symbol next to it instead of a symbol, and clicking on it opens a Tracker invite to that server. However, if it is in the server, it would have a symbol and open to that server's specific configuration page."]}]]
