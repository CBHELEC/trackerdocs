This is how you can do that, as quickly as possible.","Open https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1322305662973116486 in any browser.","If not already logged in, it will make you login to your Discord account, before bringing up a menu. Press 'Add to Server', and use the dropdown to select which server to add Tracker to, before clicking 'Continue'","To add Tracker to a server, you need to be Server Owner, Administrator or have the Manage Server permission.","Once the server has been selected, a list of permissions will show up. Review these permissions (more info on them here) and then click 'Authorise' to add Tracker to the server.","To avoid any issues, please keep all listed permissions. Tracker can work with more permissions too, however they will not be used."]},{"l":"What do the permissions mean","p":["View Channels","Allows the bot to view channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Send Messages (in threads)","Allows the bot to send messages in channels and / or threads which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Embed Links","Allows the bot to send links which have embed previews below them","Attach Files","Allows the bot to send images, audio or any files","Read Message History","Allows the bot to read previous messages in channels which it has allow or neutral permissions in","Use External Emojis","Allows the bot to use emojis from other servers in its messages and embeds.

Instead of using clunky, long commands which are quite frankly just bad, just open the Dashboard, select a server and start configuring!","To access the Dashboard, follow these steps:","On any web browser, navigate to https://dashboard.trackerbot.xyz. Be patient, it may take a second or two to load.","We recommend doing this on a Computer (PC or Laptop). The mobile UI is frankly cursed and we will fix it in due time.","Once you have opened the Dashboard, press the 'Login' button in the middle of the page. This will redirect you to the Discord Authorisation page, where you can review the permissions and then press 'Authorise'.","Once these steps have been followed, you should see a grid of the servers that you are in. You are now ready to start configuring!"]}],[{"l":"Using the Dashboard","p":["If you are following this in order, which is unlikely, you previously will have opened, and logged into the Dashboard. You are now ready to start configuring your server's settings, so let's do that now.","To configure your server, follow these steps:","Once again, we recommend doing this on a Computer (PC or Laptop). The mobile UI is frankly cursed and we will fix it in due time.","You need to actually pick a server to configure, so look through the grid of servers until you find the one you want to configure. Then simply click (or press) on that server to open it. If Tracker is not in that server, it will appear greyed out with a symbol next to it instead of a symbol, and clicking on it opens a Tracker invite to that server. However, if it is in the server, it would have a symbol and open to that server's specific configuration page.","Now you've selected a server, you can start to configure the various settings. The first of these you will see is skullboard. To find out more about skullboard, click here. To configure it, click the dropdown menu the show a list of the server's channels. Then simply click the channel you want skullboard to send to, and click 'Set Channel'. If you want to disable skullboard, click the '\uD83D\uDEAB | Disable' option and click 'Set Channel'.","Below skullboard, you can see a slightly larger dropdown box. This is how you can configure permission roles. To find out more about permission roles, click here. Click on the dropdown box, and you see a list of roles in your server. From there, its easy - click on a role you want to give permissions for (see permissions here), and then click 'Set Roles' to confirm that. To remove permission roles, click the cute lil' next to the role you want to remove, before clicking 'Set Roles' to confirm that.","Finally, after permission roles, there are a series of buttons. These toggle various features, more info on which can be found here. For each feature which can be toggled, there are two buttons. ' Enable' and ' Disable'. It's simple enough as is, but to enable the feature you click ' Enable' and to disable the feature you click ' Disable'. These auto-save as you click them."]}],[{"l":"Page 1"}],[{"l":"Page 2"}]]
